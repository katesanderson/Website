            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I started my coding journey with a single module in Computer Science during university, and from there, I took the initiative to teach myself through Codecademy. Now, I'm pursuing the CFG degree in Software Engineering and the Masters+ in DevOps. I'm passionate about learning and growing in the tech world.</p>
            <p>I am a passionate coder with a diverse set of skills and experiences. Outside of programming, I enjoy skiing, horse riding, and sewing my own clothes. During my time at university, I served as a Student Listener, receiving 40 hours of training in active listening to support my peers. I also tutored coding at Code Cadets, an after-school program where I helped students develop their programming skills. These experiences have strengthened my communication, leadership, and problem-solving abilities. Additionally, I’m passionate about traveling and exploring new cultures, always seeking opportunities to learn and grow.</p>
